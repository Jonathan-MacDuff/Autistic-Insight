  Hi, I'm Jonathan MacDuff - an autistic full-stack software developer who's spent 8 years as the #1 salesperson at my company, and now I'm using AI to help businesses systematize the kind of success most people leave to chance.

  My background is unconventional. I've been the top-performing sales rep for over 8 years, consistently generating twice the business of my peers - not because I'm naturally outgoing, but because I built a systematic approach to something most people do by instinct. After a tough first month, I solved sales like a puzzle. I've held the #1 spot ever since.

  Now I'm transitioning into software development - a field that actually comes naturally to me. I'm experienced in Python (Flask), JavaScript (React), and building scalable systems. But what makes me different is how I combine technical skills with proven business results.

  My autism is my competitive advantage. It shapes how I spot patterns, deconstruct complex systems, and approach problems from angles others miss. That's what "autistic insight" means - it's not just a diagnosis, it's a systematic way of thinking that creates real value.

  I've recently discovered I can use AI to accelerate my work by 10-20x. What took me months to build, I can now accomplish in days using advanced language models. I'm professionally trained in AI model behavior, having worked as an AI trainer parsing outputs for accuracy and safety.

  Here's what I'm building now: AI-powered business optimization services that combine my 8 years of sales excellence with cutting-edge AI analysis. I help companies systematize what high performers do instinctively - using pattern recognition that most humans miss and AI capabilities that most consultants don't have.

  My communication skills aren't natural - they're learned. Eight years in sales taught me how to listen, translate complex ideas, and connect with people in ways that actually work. That experience now informs how I collaborate and deliver results, whether I'm coding or consulting.

  I'm looking for businesses ready to systematize success rather than leave it to chance. If you want to see what happens when proven sales methodology meets advanced AI analysis, let's talk.
